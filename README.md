# Magnetic-Field-Visualizer-
My project is a magnetic field visualizer basically i will use an arduino and a hall effect sensor to measure the strength and also find the polarity of a magnetic field it will also have a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity and ofc lots of leds to visualize the strength and polarity
