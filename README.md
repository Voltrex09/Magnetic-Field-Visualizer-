# Magnetic-Field-Visualizer-
My project is a magnetic field visualizer basically i will use an arduino and a hall effect sensor to measure the strength and also find the polarity of a magnetic field it will also have a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity and ofc lots of leds to visualize the strength and polarity 

I actually came up with this project while i was on the subway watching a veritasium video the following week we also talked about the magnetic field at school and i got intrested the original idea was to somehow visualise a magnetic field on a screen but that was kinda hard so i came up with this idea i present to you now.
